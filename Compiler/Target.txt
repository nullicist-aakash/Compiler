During pass 1:
Function overloading is not allowed.//
A record type name should not be redefined anywhere

During pass 2:
The type of an identifier of union data type is reported as an error.
An identifier cannot be declared multiple times in the same scope.
An identifier declared globally cannot be declared anywhere else in function definitions.
The parameter passed of union data type is reported as error.
A variant record passed as a parameter must have a discriminator named as tagvalue.
The type of tagvalue field is integer. If it is of real type or record type then it is reported as error.
A while statement must redefine the variable that participates in the iterations.
The parameters being returned by a function must be assigned a value. If a parameter does not get a value assigned within the function definition, it should be reported as an error.
The function cannot be invoked recursively.
A function definition for a function being used (say F1) by another (say F2) must precede the definition of the function using it(i.e. F2).
Number of actual parameters must be same as that of formal parameters.

During Type check:
The type of an identifier is the type appearing while declaring the variable.
// An identifier must be declared before its use.
// Number of actual parameters must be same as that of formal parameters.
// The types of formal and actual parameters must be same.
//WTF IS THIS IDK// The types and the number of parameters returned by a function must be the same as that of the parameters used in invoking the function.
// The right hand side expression of an assignment statement must be of the same type as that of the left hand side identifier.

//record variable int to real not allowed
//record scalar multi allowed
//int real mult not allowed
//division tests - real int , int real, real real, int int -> all LHS real - assign to int then error
//boolean testcases - int comparison with real not allowed
//logical op between int and real not allowed
if record has union, record should have tagvalue
type of tagvalue is integer




Runtime:
The parameter of variant record type (for variant field only) is type checked at run type as described above.



// Summary
Till the end of pass 1:
	//1. No repeated record/union definitions. 
	//2. No duplicate function names. 
	3. Check if typedef record/union exists 
	4. Correct struct type(record or union) used in definetype 
	//5. Alias exists

Till the end of pass 2:

For functions:
	1. Input/Output parameter types are defined

For variables:
	variables have valid type (Should give error for FP 3,4 case)
	No datatype of union
	No duplicate variables
	No duplicate global variables

For structs:
	Valid type entry
	Variable name repeated
	Support for variant record - Atmost one union per record. If union, search for "tagValue". If not found, error
	
For statements:
	Variable declared before use
	Function declared and defined before use 
	while statement variable update *
	Valid number of args in function call and return *
	
	
Width calculation phase:
	Topo sort					-- No circular will be given in test cases
	Union width recalculation
